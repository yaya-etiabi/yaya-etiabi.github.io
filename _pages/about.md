## Who am I ?
<!-- A newly minted Ph.D. in **Computer & Communication Sciences** and a passionate advocate for **AI Literacy**. In an era increasingly shaped by intelligent systems, I believe that understanding AI is not just an advantage, but a fundamental necessity for equal opportunity. My journey in **computer & communication sciences and engineering** has ignited a deep drive to not only innovate at the forefront of AI but also to democratize its understanding. 
Specifically, My PhD work lived at the crossroads of AI/ML, wireless communication, and IoT networks, but my vision extends far beyond algorithms. I strive to ensure that the AI revolution doesn’t just advance technology, but also uplifts people. -->
A newly minted Ph.D. in **Computer & Communication Sciences** and a passionate advocate for **AI Literacy**. As we move deeper into an era defined by intelligent systems, I firmly believe understanding AI isn't just a nice-to-have skill—it's a vital stepping stone toward equal opportunity for all.

Throughout my journey in computer & communication sciences and engineering, I’ve discovered a real drive to do more than just push the boundaries of AI innovation. I want to help bridge the gap, ensuring people from all walks of life can grasp and benefit from this incredible technology.
During my Ph.D., I dove into projects that sat at the intersection of AI/ML, wireless communication, and IoT networks. But for me, research is about more than algorithms or models—it's about creating an AI-driven future that not only advances technology but also empowers and uplifts people.


## My Research Focus  
Building on my doctoral research, my focus is now on  **Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC)** for **intelligent applications in emerging wireless networks**. I am particularly interested in **Edge AI**, with a focus on federated edge learning and edge inference, especially in the resource-constrained environments of the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. My previous work on **federated and meta-learning for wireless localization** laid a strong foundation, and I am now eager to explore how these advancements, combined with ISCC principles, can drive the development of intelligent, efficient, and privacy-preserving edge networks.  

# Beyond Research 

## Beyond Algorithms: Advocating for AI-Literacy
My passion extends beyond the lab. Recognizing the profound impact of AI on our society, I am a strong proponent of **AI Literacy**. I firmly believe that empowering individuals with a foundational understanding of AI is paramount for building a future where everyone can thrive, regardless of their technical background. This conviction fuels my commitment to bridge the knowledge gap and ensure that the opportunities presented by AI are accessible to all, fostering a more equitable and informed society.

## A Triad of Dedication: Learning, Doing, and Sharing. [And Repeating] 
I see myself as a dedicated **learner**, constantly seeking new knowledge and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. This inherent curiosity is coupled with a work ethic, driving me to tackle complex challenges with dedication. Importantly, I am also a passionate **teacher** who finds immense satisfaction in sharing knowledge and mentoring others. Whether through formal instruction, community initiatives, or informal discussions, I am committed to spreading awareness, fostering critical thinking about AI, and inspiring the next generation of innovators. My aim is to cultivate an ecosystem of learning and collaboration, where knowledge empowers everyone.
