<p>I took part in several editions of the <b>Doctoral Days</b> at <b>UM6P (University Mohammed VI Polytechnique)</b>, where I presented multiple posters and gave an oral presentation on my ongoing research (at the time).</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the event was being awarded <b>Best Oral Presenter</b>. The presentation covered my work on <b>machine learning for indoor localization</b>, with an emphasis on <b>federated learning</b>. It was a rewarding experience to share my findings and receive feedback from peers.</p>

<!-- <p>The Doctoral Days also provided an opportunity to engage in discussions, exchange ideas, and learn from other researchers in various fields. It was a great setting for collaboration and networking.</p> -->
