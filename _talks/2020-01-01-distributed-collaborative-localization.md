In this talk, I presented a distributed localization algorithm designed for IoT environments. The algorithm is based on a convex relaxation of the Huber loss function. I discussed how this approach addresses the challenges of achieving accurate localization in IoT networks, particularly in the presence of Non-Line-of-Sight links.
