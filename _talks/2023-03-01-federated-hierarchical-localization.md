In this presentation, I introduced a federated learning (FL) framework for hierarchical 3D indoor localization using a deep neural network. This work tackles the challenges of privacy issues and resource constraints in indoor positioning. I presented an approach that exploits the hierarchy between floors and buildings to train an accurate localization model while preserving user privacy.
